      Projects** documentation for the endpoints concerning our legacy projects
      module._


      > ⚠️ (July 2023) The projects module has been completely overhauled and is
      currently only available for new project users. Existing project users only
      have access to the old projects module.

      > Over the course of the next few months, next generation projects will also
      be made available to existing project users, including the migration of
      existing project data.


      > To avoid naming collisions, all endpoints of the new projects module can
      be found under `/projects-v2`, for example `/projects-v2/projects.list`.

      > To avoid confusing "new projects" with "creating a new project", we opted
      for "projects-v2" over "new" as the prefix.
